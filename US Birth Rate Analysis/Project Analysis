Project Analysis 
From the visualizations, the following conclusions could be made:

1. The number of male births consistently exceeded the number of female births between 1969 and 1988. 
2. There is a slight increase in the number of births during the summer months (June, July, and August) for both males and females.
3. There is a slight dip in the number of births on weekends (Saturday and Sunday) compared to weekdays

NOTE: Overall, this project aims to provide a detailed analysis of birth rate data from 1969, with the goal of identifying any interesting patterns or trends in the data.
