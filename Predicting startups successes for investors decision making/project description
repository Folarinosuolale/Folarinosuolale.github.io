This project is focused on performing a multiple linear regression analysis on a dataset of 50 startups, examining the relationship between various factors and their success. 

The dataset is loaded from a CSV file and categorical data is encoded using one-hot encoding. 

The data is then split into training and test sets, and a multiple linear regression model is trained on the training set. 

Predictions are made on the test set and the results are printed. 

The project also uses backward elimination to determine which variables have the most significant impact on startup success, and outputs the results of the analysis using the statsmodels library. 

This project can serve as a starting point for further analysis of startup success and the factors that influence it for possible investors.
