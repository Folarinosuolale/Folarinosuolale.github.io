This Python project is an implementation of polynomial regression to predict salaries based on position levels. 

The dataset used is 'Position_Salaries.csv' which contains information about employee positions and their respective salaries.

The project starts by importing necessary libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas. 

The dataset is then imported and split into two variables, X and y, where X contains position level and y contains salaries.

Next, a linear regression model is trained on the entire dataset to establish a baseline model. 
Afterward, a polynomial regression model of degree 4 is trained on the dataset to see if the model can fit the data better than the linear model.

The polynomial model is then visualized using Matplotlib to compare its accuracy with that of the linear model. 

The polynomial model's prediction for new data is made by inputting a position level of 6.5.

The resulting graphs and predictions are displayed to give a clear understanding of the polynomial regression model's capabilities in predicting salaries based on position levels.

The polynomial model's prediction was evaluated and it convincingly provides a better prediction of salary based on the position level of an employee.

This project could be used by the HR department of any firm to allocated right salary range to new recruits based on the position level without making a mistake.
