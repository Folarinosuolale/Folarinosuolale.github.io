In this project, I implemented powerful data analysis and visualization capabilities of the pandas and matplotlib libraries in Python to delve into trends in Netflix movies.
I started by creating a Python dictionary of movie durations from 2011 to 2020, which I then converted into a pandas DataFrame and visualized using a line plot.

I then expanded the analysis by loading a CSV file containing information on Netflix movies, and explored how movie trends have changed over time, as well as the impact of different genres on movie durations. 

The code is fully documented with comments and can be easily adapted to analyze other datasets related to the entertainment industry
