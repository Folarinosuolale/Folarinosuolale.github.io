Stock price prediction is a widely popular application of machine learning and data science. 

In this project, the aim is to predict the future stock prices of a given company using a Random Forest Regression model. 
The project is implemented using Python and several popular libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.

To begin with, I loaded a dataset from a CSV file containing historical stock market data for the said company. 
The dataset is then preprocessed by normalizing the stock price values using a MinMaxScaler to ensure that all values fall within a specified range. 
The data is then split into training and testing sets, with the training set used to train the model and the testing set used to evaluate the model's performance.

Next,the Random Forest Regression model is created and trained using the training data. 
The model uses the previous 60 days' stock prices as inputs and predicts the next day's stock price. 
The number of estimators in the model is set to 100 to provide a more accurate prediction.

After training the model, the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance. 
The model's predictions are then inverse transformed using the scaler to obtain the actual predicted stock prices. 
The root mean squared error (RMSE) is calculated to measure the model's accuracy in predicting the future stock prices.

Finally, the predicted and actual stock prices are plotted against each other using Matplotlib to visualize the model's performance. 
The resulting plot provides a clear visual representation of the model's ability to predict future stock prices.

NB: By developing a reliable stock market price prediction model, traders and investors can make more informed decisions, leading to improved investment returns. 
This project can be further enhanced by exploring different algorithms, using more data, and incorporating additional features such as news sentiment analysis or market indices to enhance the accuracy of the model.
