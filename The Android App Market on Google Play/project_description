Google Play Store Apps and Reviews Analysis
Mobile apps have become a ubiquitous part of our daily lives, and the Google Play Store is one of the largest app distribution platforms in the world. 
With millions of apps available to users, it's important for developers and businesses to understand how to make their apps more discoverable, retain users, and ultimately drive growth.

In this project, I performed a comprehensive analysis of the Google Play Store by comparing over ten thousand apps across different categories. 
I looked for insights in the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention.

The project involves the following tasks:

Data Loading: I loaded the dataset consisting of two files: 'apps.csv' and 'user_reviews.csv'.
Data Cleaning: I cleaned the data by removing special characters from the 'Installs' and 'Price' columns and converting their data types to float. We also drop duplicate entries from the dataset.
Data Exploration: I explored the dataset to gain insights about the app categories, ratings, sizes, and prices.
Category Analysis: I analyzed the distribution of apps across different categories and identify the most popular categories based on the number of installs.
Price Analysis:I analyzed the distribution of app prices and identify the most popular price ranges.
Sentiment Analysis: I analyzed the sentiment of user reviews to gain insights about user opinions and identify areas for improvement.
Conclusion: I summarized our findings and provide recommendations for developers and businesses to improve their app visibility, user retention, and overall growth.

The project is implemented in Python using the pandas and matplotlib libraries. 
The code is organized into modular functions that can be easily modified or extended for other datasets or analyses.

The project can be used as a starting point for data analysis and visualization in the field of mobile app development, and the code can be adapted and extended for other datasets or analyses. 
The project can be run locally using Jupyter Notebook or in the cloud using services like Google Colab or Azure Notebook
